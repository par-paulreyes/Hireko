## 🌎 Introduction
<div align="justify">In recent years, freelancing has taken the economic world by storm -- transforming the traditional workplace structure into its more flexible alternative. Through the aforementioned practice, both employees and employers are given utmost autonomy in their respective work arrangements while avoiding certain time and location constraints. With that said, environmental concerns have called for companies and businesses to come up innovative solutions to mitigate and reduce their respective ecological footprints. Bridging these two, the rise of service applications focused on eco-friendly tasks offers a hopeful path for sustainable endeavors, simultaneously empowering freelancers and businesses to participate in environmental initiatives.

This project tackles the increasing demand for sustainable solutions and aims to gauge the gig economy's potential to foster beneficial environmental impact.
